Then(t, s)        applies t to the input goal and s to every subgoal produced by t.
OrElse(t, s)      first applies t to the given goal, if it fails then returns the result of s applied to the given goal.
Repeat(t)         Keep applying the given tactic until no subgoal is modified by it.
Repeat(t, n)      Keep applying the given tactic until no subgoal is modified by it, or the number of iterations is greater than n.
TryFor(t, ms)     Apply tactic t to the input goal, if it does not return in ms millisenconds, it fails.
With(t, params)   Apply the given tactic using the given parameters.
