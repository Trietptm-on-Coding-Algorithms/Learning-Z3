# The basic idea behind pattern-based quantifier instantiation is in a sense straight-forward:
# Annotate a quantified formula using a pattern that contains all the bound variables.
# Pattern is an expression (that does not contain binding operations, such as quantifiers)
# that contains variables bound by a quantifier.
# Then instantiate the quantifier whenever a term that matches the pattern is create during search

# Make sure that Model-based quantifier instantiation engine is disabled!
# s.set(auto_config=False, mbqi=False)

f = Function('f', IntSort(), IntSort())
g = Function('g', IntSort(), IntSort())
a, b, c = Ints('a b c')
x = Int('x')

s.set(auto_config=False, mbqi=False)
s.add( ForAll(x, f(g(x)) == x, patterns = [f(g(x))]),
       g(a) == c,
       g(b) == c,
       a != b )

# When the more permissive pattern g(x) is used, Z3 proves the formula to be unsatisfiable.
# More restrictive patterns minimize the number of instantiations (and potentially improve performance)

s.set(auto_config=False, mbqi=False)
s.add( ForAll(x, f(g(x)) == x, patterns = [g(x)]),
       g(a) == c,
       g(b) == c,
       a != b )

# Display solver state using internal format

# Some patterns may also create long instantiation chains.
# Consider following assertion
#
# ForAll([x, y], Implies(subtype(x, y), subtype(array_of(x), array_of(y))), patterns=[subtype(x,y)])
#
# The axiom gets instantiated whenever there is some ground term of the form subtype(s, t).
# The instantiation causes a fresh ground term subtype(array_of(s), array_of(t)), which enables a new instantiation
# This undesirable situation is called a matching loop. Z3 uses many heuristics to break matching loops. 

# What defines the terms that are created during search? 
# In the context of most SMT solvers, and of the Simplify theorem prover, terms exist as part of the input formula, 
# they are of course also created by instantiating quantifiers, but terms are also implicitly created when 
# equalities are asserted. The last point means that terms are considered up to congruence and pattern matching 
# takes place modulo ground equalities. 
# We call the matching problem E-matching.

s.set(auto_config=False, mbqi=False)
s.add( ForAll(x, f(g(x)) == x, patterns = [f(g(x))]),
       a == g(b),
       b == c,
       f(a) != c )

# The terms f(a) and f(g(b)) are equal modulo the equalities.
# The pattern f(g(x)) can be matched and x bound to b and the equality f(g(b)) == b is deduced.
