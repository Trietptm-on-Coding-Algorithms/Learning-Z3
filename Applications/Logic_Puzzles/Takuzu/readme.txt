Takuzu is simple logic game.
The objective is to fill a square grid with either a "1" or "0".
The rule:
- You can't put more than two identical numbers next to each others in a line (i.e. you can't have a "111" or "000")
- The number of 1s and 0s on each row and column must match
- You can't have two identical rows or columns.

Example:
....
0.0.
..0.
