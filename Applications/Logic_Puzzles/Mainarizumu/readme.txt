Mainarizumu is logic game played in square grid (typically 7x7)
The objective is to fill with numbers.
Provided:
- greater-than or less-than sign connecting two adjacent squares.
- circled digit connecting two adjacent squares

The rule:
- No digit is repeated in any row or column
- If two squares are connected by a greater-than or less-than sign, then the digits in those squares must obey that inequality
- if two squares are connected by a circled digit, then the digits in those squares must differ by exactly that amount.
